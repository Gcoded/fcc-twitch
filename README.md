Twitch App - FreeCodeCamp project

Based on a set of preselected users, this app displays which Twitch channels are currently streaming or inactive.  Also displays if a channel no longer exists.  The logo displayed and the channel name are links that lead to the streaming page.  There is also a mesage displaying what is streaming on the channel or if it is inactive.
